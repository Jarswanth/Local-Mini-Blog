Built and tested a basic blog-style web application on localhost using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. Implemented CRUD functionality for blog posts with in-memory data storage and unique IDs using UUID. Enabled RESTful routing with method-override and used EJS templates to display dynamic content. Practiced form handling, server-side rendering, and routing in an Express-based environment for hands-onÂ learning.
